# Read: Exception Handling & Debugging

Before you start debugging, make sure you've identified the problem you're trying to solve:

1. What did you expect your code to do?
2. What happened instead?
3. If something else happened, what is the symptom of the problem? 
4. Do you already suspect where this problem occurred in your code?

## Examine your assumptions

Before you investigate a bug or an error, think of the assumptions that made you expect a certain result.

1. are you using the right API?
2. are you using an API correctly?
3. does your code contain any typos?
4. Did you make a change to your code and assume it  is unrelated to the problem that you're seeing?
