# Readings: EF Core & APIs

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code they usually need to write.

EF Core supports many database engines, see Database Providers for details.

## The Model
With EF Core, data access is performed using a model. A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database, allowing you to query and save data. See Creating a Model to learn more.

You can generate a model from an existing database, hand code a model to match your database, or use EF Migrations to create a database from your model, and then evolve it as your model changes over time.

## Querying
Instances of your entity classes are retrieved from the database using Language Integrated Query (LINQ)

## Saving Data
Data is created, deleted, and modified in the database using instances of your entity classes.

## Limitations of model seed data
This type of seed data is managed by migrations and the script to update the data that's already in the database needs to be generated without connecting to the database. This imposes some restrictions:

The primary key value needs to be specified even if it's usually generated by the database. It will be used to detect data changes between migrations.
Previously seeded data will be removed if the primary key is changed in any way.
