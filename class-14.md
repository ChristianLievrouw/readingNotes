# Read: 14a css transformations, transitions, and animation
- transforms have two different settings, two dimensional and three dimensional each of them have their own properties and values
## 2D transforms 
- 2D work on a x and y axis 
- 2D rotate
  - rotate element from 0 to 360 degrees
  - positive number (rotate clockwise), negative numbers (rotate counterclockwise)
- 2D scale
  - scale value makes elements smaller
  - 1 default .01 - 1
- 2D translate 
  - will change the object on the x and y plans
- best way to tell a class is in a transition state is with a ``` :hover :focus :active : target ``` pseudo-class
- four transition related properties
1. transition-property
  - determines which properties will be altered
2. transition-duration
  - duration of the changing properties, you can set different times fo different properties
3. transition-timing-function
  - speed of the transition 
4. transition-delay
## animations
when transitions need to have multiple states that is where animations take over
```@keyframes``` indicates a animation
if you want your animation to run more than one you use the ```animation-iteration-count```

Animation direction ``` animation-direction ```
  - normal, reverse, alternate, alternate-reverse

Animation play state
  - allows animation to be paused with keywords running and paused

## Building the perfect team
In the reading it really shows that when it comes to over all success in the work place that better attitudes and true teamwork over come all. I feel the exact same way that when in a groupe if there is a couple people trying to really show dominance that it makes it really intimidating to speak up. When everyone is open to all ideas, even ones that do not work it makes it easier to speak up. When you can speak without the fear of being judged you can really accomplish goals individually and in a team setting.
