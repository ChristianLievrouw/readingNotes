1. The Consumer makes a request to the Service Provider authorization endpoint to authorize the user.
2. The Service Provider authenticates the user and prompts them whether to authorize the Consumer to access their information.
- The Client ID and secret are obtained when registering your application on the Service Provider’s website. Some Service Providers may call them something else, like Facebook, for example, will refer to them as the App ID and App Secret. The Authorization and Token endpoints can typically be obtained from the developer documentation of the Service Provider.

3. If the user authorizes the Consumer, the Service Provider redirects back to the redirect URI on the Consumer’s website with a temporary access code.
- The redirect URI is something which you can specify when configuring the OAuth authentication on the Consumer. This needs to match up with whatever you specify when creating the application on the Service Provider. This will normally be referred to as either a redirect URL or callback URL or some sort of variation of that.

4. The Consumer calls the token endpoint on the Service Provider website to exchange the code for a more permanent access token.
- You will see they list the Authorization endpoint as
```https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize```

5. The Service Provider grants an access token which can be used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected resources
 - and the Token endpoint as
```https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token```

## Use SecretManager to store tokens assigned by login providers
Social login providers assign Application Id and Application Secret tokens during the registration process. The exact token names vary by provider. These tokens represent the credentials your app uses to access their API. The tokens constitute the "secrets" that can be linked to your app configuration with the help of Secret Manager. Secret Manager is a more secure alternative to storing the tokens in a configuration file, such as appsettings.json.

## Multiple authentication providers
When the app requires multiple providers, chain the provider extension methods behind AddAuthentication:
```services.AddAuthentication()```
    ```.AddMicrosoftAccount(microsoftOptions => { ... })```
    ```.AddGoogle(googleOptions => { ... })```
    ```.AddTwitter(twitterOptions => { ... })```
    ```.AddFacebook(facebookOptions => { ... });```
