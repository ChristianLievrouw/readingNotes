# Read: Hash Tables

## What is a Hashtable?
### Terminology:
## Hash:
A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
## Buckets:
A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
## Collisions: 
A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## What Are they
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored, we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity. This is ideal when quick lookups are required.

## Structure
Hashing
Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code.

## Collisions
A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. As mentioned earlier, a “perfect hash” will never have any collisions. To put this into perspective, the worst possible hash is one that hashes every single key to the same exact index of an array. The more keys you have hashed to a specific index, the more key/value pair combos you can potentially have.

## Why do we use them?
Hold unique values
Dictionary
Library

## Hash maps do this to store values:
> accept a key
> calculate the hash of the key
> use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
> store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

## Hash maps do this to read value:
> accept a key
> calculate the hash of the key
> use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
> use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
> search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given
