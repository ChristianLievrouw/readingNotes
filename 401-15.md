# Read: Data Transfer Objects

A Data Transfer Object (commonly known as a DTO) is usually an instance of a POCO (plain old CLR object) class used as a container to encapsulate data and pass it from one layer of the application to another. You would typically find DTOs being used in the service layer to return data back to the presentation layer. The biggest advantage of using DTOs is decoupling clients from your internal data structures.

## Why use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)?
When designing and developing an application, if you’re using models to pass data between the layers and sending data back to the presentation layer, then you’re exposing the internal data structures of your application. That’s a major design flaw in your application.

By decoupling your layers DTOs make life easier when you’re implementing APIs, MVC applications, and also messaging patterns such as Message Broker. A DTO is a great choice when you would like to pass a lightweight object across the wire — especially when you’re passing your object via a medium that is bandwidth-constrained.

## Use DTOs for abstraction
You can take advantage of DTOs to abstract the domain objects of your application from the user interface or the presentation layer. In doing so, the presentation layer of your application is decoupled from the service layer. So if you would like to change the presentation layer, you can do that easily while the application will continue to work with the existing domain layer. Similarly, you can change the domain layer of your application without having to change the presentation layer of the application.

## DTO serialization challenges
You should be able to serialize/deserialize a DTO seamlessly so that it can be passed down the wire. In practice, however, you might have to solve some serialization problems when working with DTOs. You might have several entities or model classes in a real-world application and each of them may hold references to each other.
