# Read: Intro to Identity

## Identity
Key to understanding how authentication works is to first understand what an identity is in ASP.NET Core 2.0. There are three classes which represent the identity of a user: Claim, ClaimsIdentity, and ClaimsPrincipal

## Claims
A Claim represents a single fact about the user. It could be the user's first name, last name, age, employer, birth date, or anything else that is true about the user. A single claim will contain only a single piece of information. A claim representing something about a user John Smith could be his first name: John. A second claim would be his last name: Smith.

Claims are represented by the Claim class in ASP.Net Core. It's most common constructor accepts two strings: type and value. The 'type' parameter is the name of the claim, while the value is the information the claim is representing about the user.

## ClaimsIdentity
An Identity represents a form of identification or, in other words, a single way of proving who you are. In real life this could be a driver's license. In ASP.Net Core, it is a ClaimsIdentity. This class represents a single form of digital identification.

A single instance of a ClaimsIdentity can be authenticated or not authenticated. According to Andrew Lock's Introduction to Authentication with ASP.NET Core, simply setting the AuthenticationType will automatically ensure the IsAuthenticated property is true. This is because if you have authenticated the identity in any way, then it must, by definition, be authenticated.

An unknown person walking up to you and making various claims about theirself and their life would be equivilent to an unauthenticated ClaimsIdentity. Lock writes that this may be useful to allow guest shopping carts (prior to a sign in, perhaps) and similar use cases.

A driver's license contains many claims about its subject: first and last names, birthdate, hair and eye colors, height, and others. Similarly, a ClaimsIdentity can contain numerous claims about a user.

## ClaimsPrincipal
A Principal represents the actual user. It can contain one or more instances of ClaimsIdentity, just like in life a person may have a driver's license, concealed-carry permit, social security card, and a passport. Each of the identities is used for a different purpose and may contain a unique set of claims, but they all identify the same user in some form or another.

To sum up, a ClaimsPrincipal represents a user and contains one or more instances of ClaimsIdentity, which in turn represent a single form of identification and contain one or more instances of Claim, which represents a single piece of information about a user. The ClaimsPrincipal is what the HttpContext.SignInAsync method accepts and passes to the specified AuthenticationHandler.

## Authentication Handlers
Authentication handlers are components that actually implement the behavior of the 5 verbs above. The default auth handler provided by ASP.NET Core is the Cookies authentication handler which implements all 5 of the verbs. It is important to note, however, that an auth handler is not required to implement all of the verbs. Oauth handlers, for instance, do not implement the SignIn verb, but rather pass off that responsibility to another auth handler, such as the Cookies auth handler.

Authentication handlers must be registered with the auth system in order to be used and are associated with schemes. A scheme is just a string that identifies a unique auth handler in a dictionary of auth handlers. The default scheme for the Cookies auth handler is “Cookies”, but it can be changed to anything. Multiple auth handlers can be used side by side, and sometimes (like in the earlier example of the Oauth handlers) use functionality provided by other auth handlers.

## Authentication Middleware
A middleware is a module that can be inserted into the startup sequence and is run on every request. The one this article is concerned with is the authentication middleware. This code checks if a user is authenticated (or not) on every request. Recall that the Authenticate verb gets the user info, but only if it exists. When the request is run, the authentication middleware asks the default scheme auth handler to run its authentication code. The auth handler returns the information to the authentication middleware which then populates the HttpContext.User object with the returned information.
