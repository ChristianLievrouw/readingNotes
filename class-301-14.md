# Read: DB normalization

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

3 reasons to normalize a database
1. minimize duplicate data
- problems with duplicating data
 1. It increases storage and decrease performance
 2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
  1. Insert Anomaly
    - There are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row
  2. Update Anomaly
    - In this case we have the same information in several rows
  3. Deletion Anomaly
    - Deletion of a row causes removal of more than one set of facts
3. simplify queries
  - making it easier to search and sort your data


1. First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
2. Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
3. Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
