# Readings: Intro to ERDs

## What is a Schema?
A SQL database contains multiple objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, functions, indexes, triggers. We define SQL Schema as a logical collection of database objects.

## Why do we use them?
Schema is mainly used to Manage several logical entities in one physical database. Schemas offer a 
convenient way to separate database users from database object owners.

## What do they look like?
What are the different types of Database Keys?
Super, Primary, Candidate, Alternate, Foreign, Compound, Composite, and Surrogate Key.

## What is a Primary Key?
PRIMARY KEY is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table. The Primary Key can't be a duplicate meaning the same value can't appear more than once in the table. A table cannot have more than one primary key.

## What is a Foreign Key?
FOREIGN KEY is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. The purpose of Foreign keys is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity. It acts as a cross-reference between two tables as it references the primary key of another table.

## What is a Composite Key?
COMPOSITE KEY is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify rows in a table. The combination of columns guarantees uniqueness

## How are they different? When do you use 1 over the others?
Keys ensure that you can uniquely identify a table record despite these challenges.

## What are Relationships in a relational database?
Foreign keys that help tables relate to each other

## What is a 1:1 relationship?
When a row in a table is related to only one role in another table and vice versa,we say that is a one to one relationship.

## What is a Many:Many relationship?
a many-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities A and B in which A may contain a parent instance for which there are many children in B and vice versa.

## How about a 1: Many or a Many:1?
a one-to-many relationship exists when one row in table A may be linked with many rows in table B, but one row in table B is linked to only one row in table A.
