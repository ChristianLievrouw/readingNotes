Routing is responsible for matching incoming HTTP requests and dispatching those requests to the app's executable endpoints. Endpoints are the app's units of executable request-handling code. Endpoints are defined in the app and configured when the app starts. The endpoint matching process can extract values from the request's URL and provide those values for request processing. Using endpoint information from the app, routing is also able to generate URLs that map to endpoints.

Apps can configure routing using:

Controllers
Razor Pages
SignalR
gRPC Services
Endpoint-enabled middleware such as Health Checks.
Delegates and lambdas registered with routing.

Routing uses a pair of middleware, registered by UseRouting and UseEndpoints:

UseRouting adds route matching to the middleware pipeline. This middleware looks at the set of endpoints defined in the app, and selects the best match based on the request.
UseEndpoints adds endpoint execution to the middleware pipeline. It runs the delegate associated with the selected endpoint.

Endpoint

The MapGet method is used to define an endpoint. An endpoint is something that can be:

Selected, by matching the URL and HTTP method.
Executed, by running the delegate.

Endpoint metadata
In the preceding example, there are two endpoints, but only the health check endpoint has an authorization policy attached. If the request matches the health check endpoint, /healthz, an authorization check is performed. This demonstrates that endpoints can have extra data attached to them. This extra data is called endpoint metadata:

The metadata can be processed by routing-aware middleware.
The metadata can be of any .NET type.
Routing concepts
The routing system builds on top of the middleware pipeline by adding the powerful endpoint concept. Endpoints represent units of the app's functionality that are distinct from each other in terms of routing, authorization, and any number of ASP.NET Core's systems.

URL matching
Is the process by which routing matches an incoming request to an endpoint.
Is based on data in the URL path and headers.
Can be extended to consider any data in the request.

URL generation concepts
URL generation:

Is the process by which routing can create a URL path based on a set of route values.
Allows for a logical separation between endpoints and the URLs that access them.

Route template reference
Tokens within {} define route parameters that are bound if the route is matched. More than one route parameter can be defined in a route segment, but route parameters must be separated by a literal value. For example, {controller=Home}{action=Index} isn't a valid route, since there's no literal value between {controller} and {action}. Route parameters must have a name and may have additional attributes specified.

Literal text other than route parameters (for example, {id}) and the path separator / must match the text in the URL. Text matching is case-insensitive and based on the decoded representation of the URL's path. To match a literal route parameter delimiter { or }, escape the delimiter by repeating the character. For example {{ or }}.
