When to Use Context
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 

Before You Use Context
Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

DEFINITION OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
Management role group – you can add and remove members.
Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.
Primary – the primary contact for a specific account or role.
Billing – access for one end-user to the billing account.
Technical – assigned to users that perform technical tasks.
Administrative – access for users that perform administrative tasks.

BENEFITS OF RBAC
Managing and auditing network access is essential to information security. Access can and should be granted on a need-to-know basis. With hundreds or thousands of employees, security is more easily maintained by limiting unnecessary access to sensitive information based on each user’s established role within the organization. Other advantages include:
Reducing administrative work and IT support.
Maximizing operational efficiency. 
Improving compliance.

BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING RBAC
Implementing a RBAC into your organization shouldn’t happen without a great deal of consideration. There are a series of broad steps to bring the team onboard without causing unnecessary confusion and possible workplace irritations. Here are a few things to map out first.
