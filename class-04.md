## Layouts
When starting you html page html treats each element as a block that stacks on each other. Containing elements holds other elements inside its block.

# Fixed vs Liquid layouts
1. Fixed layouts 
- fixed layouts give the programer more control over elements and text ing the page when laying out the page but can be a problem when users are using multiple sized screens.
2. Liquid Layouts
- liquid layouts give the browsers flexibility across many different sized displays but also can cause a messy look on displays that are to big or to small.

# Functions and Objects

## Functions 
let you put a series of statements together and then by calling the function you can call it anywhere you want in the code

## Declaring a function 
- use function keyword to declare a function and then give the function a name to be called by later then add the code that needs to be ran once the function is called. Sometimes you declare a variable that needs parameters passed into it to run. You can also create function expressions that store  an anonymous function stored in a variable. Immediately invoked functions are functions that are ran immediately vs storing code to run later.
