# Reading: Classes and Memory management

## Reference types
- A type that is defined as a class is a reference type. At run time, when you declare a variable of a reference type, the variable contains the value null until you explicitly create an instance of the class by using the new operator, or assign it an object of a compatible type that may have been created elsewhere, as shown in the following example:
## Declaring Classes
- Classes are declared by using the class keyword followed by a unique identifier, as shown in the following example:
## Creating objects.
Objects can be created by using the new keyword followed by the name of the class that the object will be based on, like this:
## Constructor
A constructor is a method whose name is the same as the name of its type. Its method signature includes only the method name and its parameter list; it does not include a return type. 
## Properties
A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called accessors. This enables data to be accessed easily and still helps promote the safety and flexibility of methods.
## Stack vs. Heap: What's the difference?
- Stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of what's executing in our code (or what's been "called").  The Heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of our objects (our data, well... most of it - we'll get to that later.)
- Think of the Stack as a series of boxes stacked one on top of the next.  We keep track of what's going on in our application by stacking another box on top every time we call a method (called a Frame).  We can only use what's in the top box on the stack.  When we're done with the top box (the method is done executing) we throw it away and proceed to use the stuff in the previous box on the top of the stack. The Heap is similar except that its purpose is to hold information (not keep track of execution most of the time) so anything in our Heap can be accessed at any time
- With the Heap, there are no constraints as to what can be accessed like in the stack.  The Heap is like the heap of clean laundry on our bed that we have not taken the time to put away yet - we can grab what we need quickly.  The Stack is like the stack of shoe boxes in the closet where we have to take off the top one to get to the one underneath it.
