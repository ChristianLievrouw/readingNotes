# Read: 10 - The call stack and debugging 
## call stack

- a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

## error message and debugging 

## Reference errors
- This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

## Syntax errors
- I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

## Range errors
- Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

## Type errors
- Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

## Debugging
- console.log errors to find where the code stops executing 
- Pay attention to call stack

Being able to read error messages and practising debugging is one of your biggest weapons has a developer, do it frequently and with enough time you will notice a great decrease in the time you spend on each error that you find along the way. And remember, before a commit/push, remove all the debugging stuff from your code, we don’t want the client or another developer to get stuck on a debugger now do we?
