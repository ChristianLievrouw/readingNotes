## Building the perfect team
In the reading it really shows that when it comes to over all success in the work place that better attitudes and true teamwork over come all. I feel the exact same way that when in a groupe if there is a couple people trying to really show dominance that it makes it really intimidating to speak up. When everyone is open to all ideas, even ones that do not work it makes it easier to speak up. When you can speak without the fear of being judged you can really accomplish goals individually and in a team setting.
