Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

## About Blob storage
Blob storage is designed for:

Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
Storing files for distributed access.
Streaming video and audio.
Writing to log files.
Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

## What is a Layout
Most web apps have a common layout that provides the user with a consistent experience as they navigate from page to page. The layout typically includes common user interface elements such as the app header, navigation or menu elements, and footer.
Common HTML structures such as scripts and stylesheets are also frequently used by many pages within an app. All of these shared elements may be defined in a layout file, which can then be referenced by any view used within the app. Layouts reduce duplicate code in views.

By convention, the default layout for an ASP.NET Core app is named _Layout.cshtml. The layout files for new ASP.NET Core projects created with the templates are:
Razor Pages: Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml
Controller with views: Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml

## Partial view
A partial view is a Razor markup file (.cshtml) without an @page directive that renders HTML output within another markup file's rendered output.

The term partial view is used when developing either an MVC app, where markup files are called views, or a Razor Pages app, where markup files are called pages. This topic generically refers to MVC views and Razor Pages pages as markup files.

## When to use partial views
Partial views are an effective way to:
Break up large markup files into smaller components.

In a large, complex markup file composed of several logical pieces, there's an advantage to working with each piece isolated into a partial view. The code in the markup file is manageable because the markup only contains the overall page structure and references to partial views.
Reduce the duplication of common markup content across markup files.

When the same markup elements are used across markup files, a partial view removes the duplication of markup content into one partial view file. When the markup is changed in the partial view, it updates the rendered output of the markup files that use the partial view.

## What are Tag Helpers
Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. For example, the built-in ImageTagHelper can append a version number to the image name. Whenever the image changes, the server generates a new unique version for the image, so clients are guaranteed to get the current image (instead of a stale cached image). There are many built-in Tag Helpers for common tasks - such as creating forms, links, loading assets and more - and even more available in public GitHub repositories and as NuGet packages. Tag Helpers are authored in C#, and they target HTML elements based on element name, attribute name, or parent tag. For example, the built-in LabelTagHelper can target the HTML <label> element when the LabelTagHelper attributes are applied.

## The Form Tag Helper:

Generates the HTML <FORM> action attribute value for a MVC controller action or named route
Generates a hidden Request Verification Token to prevent cross-site request forgery (when used with the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute in the HTTP Post action method)

Provides the asp-route-<Parameter Name> attribute, where <Parameter Name> is added to the route values. The routeValues parameters to Html.BeginForm and Html.BeginRouteForm provide similar functionality.

Has an HTML Helper alternative Html.BeginForm and Html.BeginRouteForm
