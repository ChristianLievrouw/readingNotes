# Reading: EJ Partials 

how to add ej partials
<%- include('file/file') %>

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.

I can see how ejs partials can really help save yu time when needing to use same code throughout multiple pages in your website.
