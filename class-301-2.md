# Read:02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM
## jQuery 
- a file you use in your webpage to find elements using css-style selectors
- $()
- the object and elements are refereed to as matched set or jQuery selections
## Three reason to use jQuery 
1. Simple selectors
2. Common tasks in less code
3. Cross-browser compatibility
- when using jQuery you do not need to write a loop to iterate through multiple elements 
- you can use multiple methods at a time using dot notation called chaining
- to get element content we use ```.html()``` or ```.text()```
## updating elements 
```.html()```
```.text()```
```.replaceWith()```
```.remove()```
## inserting elements 
```.before()```
```.after()```
```.prepend()```
```.append()```
## getting and setting attribute values 
```.attr()```
```.removeAttr()```
```.addClass()```
```.removeClass()```
- placing your script tag to load jQuery before the closing body tag is the most efficient way
## 6 reasons for paired programming
1. Greater efficiency
  - when you have to people working on same problem it become easier to spot bugs and more efficient ways of completing tasks
2. Engaged collaboration
  - When two programmers are focusing and talking out loud about the code and problems it causes them to be more engaged with the code
3. Learning from fellow students
  - When someone else is helping solve the same problem they may be able to give a different more efficient way of solving the same problem
4. Social skills
  - helps improve communication skills and build strong/ closer teams
5. Job interview readiness
  - help people fit into team environments easier 
6. Work environment readiness 
  - a lot of companies do pair programming so learning to work with others is a key to success
