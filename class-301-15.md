# Read: Diversity and inclusion 

I have always thought that having a diverse group of employees would help better a company. With technology become widely easier to access means that people from all walks of life are interacting with it. If your team includes people from ALL walks of life you are better able to help direct your products to suit the masses. If you can give a user a personal experience given any situation, your device/ brand is going to be better off and more likable. When creating a device or anything you start by your target audience but when the "non-targeted" audience starts to look into it if you are able to have it perform to a way that helps them and their specific need/ wants you will see a new market.
