## The difference between Authentication and Authorisation
First of all, we should clarify the difference between these two dependent facets of security. The simple answer is that Authentication is the process of determining who you are, while Authorisation revolves around what you are allowed to do, i.e. permissions. Obviously before you can determine what a user is allowed to do, you need to know who they are, so when authorisation is required, you must also first authenticate the user in some way.

## Authentication in ASP.NET Core
The fundamental properties associated with identity have not really changed in ASP.NET Core - although they are different, they should be familiar to ASP.NET developers in general. For example, in ASP.NET 4.x, there is a property called User on HttpContext, which is of type IPrincipal, which represents the current user for a request. In ASP.NET Core there is a similar property named User, the difference being that this property is of type ClaimsPrincipal, which implements IPrincipal.

## Claims-based authentication
The concept of claims-based authentication can be a little confusing when you first come to it, but in practice it is probably very similar to approaches you are already using. You can think of claims as being a statement about, or a property of, a particular identity. That statement consists of a name and a value. For example you could have a DateOfBirth claim, FirstName claim, EmailAddress claim or IsVIP claim. Note that these statements are about what or who the identity is, not what they can do.

When an identity is created it may be assigned one or more claims issued by a trusted party. A claim is a name value pair that represents what the subject is, not what the subject can do. For example, you may have a driver's license, issued by a local driving license authority. Your driver's license has your date of birth on it. In this case the claim name would be DateOfBirth, the claim value would be your date of birth, for example 8th June 1970 and the issuer would be the driving license authority. Claims based authorization, at its simplest, checks the value of a claim and allows access to a resource based upon that value. For example if you want access to a night club the authorization process might be:

The door security officer would evaluate the value of your date of birth claim and whether they trust the issuer (the driving license authority) before granting you access.

An identity can contain multiple claims with multiple values and can contain multiple claims of the same type.
