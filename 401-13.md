# Read: Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern

## Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principal (SRP) is the idea that every method or class in your application should have exactly one reason to change. You can logically extend that to say that every class or method in your application should have exactly one (a single) job or responsibility.

## The Open/Close Principle
The Open/Close Principle (OCP) is very closely related to the previously discussed topics of Encapsulation and Inheritance. In fact it’s fair to say the OCP is concept that unifies these two tenants of OOP. OCP states that software, be it a method or a class, should be open for extension, but closed to modification.

## The Liskov Substitution Principle
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that an object in your application should be able to be replaced with a type derived from it without breaking the application.

## The Interface Segregation Principle
The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to rely on interfaces they do not use. Another way to say this is that you should make fine grained interfaces that are specific to the functions and needs of the client. 

## The Dependency Inversion Principle
Coupling and binding in software is a fact of life. For all or our efforts to eliminate the need for binding, at the end of the day our classes have to bind to something to be usable. Recognizing that, we should endeavor to make this coupling as loose as possible. This is where the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) comes into play. The DIP is the idea that code should depend on abstractions; not concrete implementations. Furthermore, those abstractions should not depend on the details; the details should depend on the abstractions. This is a slightly complex way of expressing a very simple idea. 

The SOLID Principles
S — Single Responsibility
A class should have a single responsibility
Goal
This principle aims to separate behaviours so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it won’t affect other unrelated behaviours.

O — Open-Closed
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
Goal
This principle aims to extend a Class’s behaviour without changing the existing behaviour of that Class. This is to avoid causing bugs wherever the Class is being used.

L — Liskov Substitution
If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.
Goal
This principle aims to enforce consistency so that the parent Class or its child Class can be used in the same way without any errors.

I — Interface Segregation
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.
Goal
This principle aims at splitting a set of actions into smaller sets so that a Class executes ONLY the set of actions it requires.

D — Dependency Inversion
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
Goal
This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.
