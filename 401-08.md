# Reading: Collections & Enums

## Collections

For many applications, you want to create and manage groups of related objects. There are two ways to group objects: by creating arrays of objects, and by creating collections of objects.

Arrays are most useful for creating and working with a fixed number of strongly typed objects. For information about arrays, see Arrays.

Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects. Unlike arrays, the group of objects you work with can grow and shrink dynamically as the needs of the application change. For some collections, you can assign a key to any object that you put into the collection so that you can quickly retrieve the object by using the key.

A collection is a class, so you must declare an instance of the class before you can add elements to that collection.

## Enumeration

An enumeration type (or enum type) is a value type defined by a set of named constants of the underlying integral numeric type. To define an enumeration type, use the enum keyword and specify the names of enum members:

enum Season
{
    Spring,
    Summer,
    Autumn,
    Winter
}

By default, the associated constant values of enum members are of type int; they start with zero and increase by one following the definition text order. You can explicitly specify any other integral numeric type as an underlying type of an enumeration type. You can also explicitly specify the associated constant values, as the following example shows:

enum ErrorCode : ushort
{
    None = 0,
    Unknown = 1,
    ConnectionLost = 100,
    OutlierReading = 200
}
