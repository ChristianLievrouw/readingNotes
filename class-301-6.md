# Reading:06 - Node, Express, and APIs

## what is NODE.js?
- built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine 
- the chrome v8 engine was used to enhance features such as API and HTTP libraries
- NODE.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers

## what is NODE.js used for?
- NODE.js lets us run JavaScript on the server 
- NODE.j is event driven so when a new request comes in that it cant figure out instead of trying to figure it out before continuing it calls a call back and completes later

## what kind of apps is NODE.js suited for?
- mainly apps that require some sort of real time interaction
  - chat sites
  - code share

  ## disadvantages of NODE.js
  - The fact that Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations. For example, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.

## advantages of NODE.js
- speed
- scalability 
- do everything in the same language 
- easy use of JSON
