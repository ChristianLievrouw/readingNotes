### MVC vs Razor Pages

## MVC
The routing engine is key to how ASP.NET Core decides to handle your requests.
It can be configured to route any request to any controller action.
The default routing configuration uses a combination of the controller and action names.

/<controller name>/<action name>

Once the request reaches a controller action, the logic in the action is executed and a response is returned.

## Where does my code go?
In MVC, your application code lives in the controller action.
It’s here that you’re going to validate the request, execute any business logic, call your app’s services etc, before eventually returning a response.
You can use attributes to indicate which kinds of requests your action will accept e.g. GET, POST, PUT (or any of the other HTTP verbs).

## Where does my presentation code (markup) go?
MVC actions don’t have to return a View but they typically do.
It’s in these views that you’ll put all your HTML markup.
When a view is returned, MVC needs to locate said view and it achieves this using some default conventions.
Unless told otherwise, it will look in a Views folder for a folder with the same name as the controller, then a view with the same name as the action.

e.g. Views\Staff\Index.cshtml

The key thing to note here is that MVC requests are routed to the controller action and it’s up to the action to determine whether a view is returned (and if so, which view).

## Razor Pages

With Razor Pages, when you make a request (e.g. /contact) the default ASP.NET Routing configuration will attempt to locate a Razor Page for that request in the Pages folder.
It simply looks for a page with the name used in the request (for a request to /contact that would be Contact.cshtml) and routes directly to it.
The Razor Page then acts as though it were a controller action.
For a .cshtml file to qualify as a Razor Page, it must live in the Pages folder (using default conventions) and include @page in its markup.

## Where does my code go?
Every Razor Page can have a corresponding Page Model.
If we stick to the default conventions, ASP.NET will expect that model to have the same name as the corresponding Razor page but with a .cs appended.
With Razor Pages your application code lives in these models, specifically in methods for the different HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST).

## Where does my presentation code (markup) go?
Well this is simple.
Because the request was routed directly to the specific razor page that can handle it, there’s no need to go off locating a view, the view is the one the request was routed to e.g. Contact.cshtml.
The default routing for Razor Pages is simple enough and respects subfolders, so \Pages\Staff\Profile.cshtml would be accessible via a request to /staff/profile.
Worth noting that you can omit Index as it is the default page. In this example both /staff/ and /staff/index would take you to Pages\Staff\Index.cshtml.
