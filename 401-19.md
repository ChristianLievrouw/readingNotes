# Read: Testing and Swagger

When consuming a web API, understanding its various methods can be challenging for a developer. Swagger, also known as OpenAPI, solves the problem of generating useful documentation and help pages for web APIs. It provides benefits such as interactive documentation, client SDK generation, and API discoverability.

## What is Swagger / OpenAPI?
Swagger is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. The Swagger project was donated to the OpenAPI Initiative, where it's now referred to as OpenAPI. Both names are used interchangeably; however, OpenAPI is preferred. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a service without any direct access to the implementation (source code, network access, documentation). One goal is to minimize the amount of work needed to connect disassociated services. Another goal is to reduce the amount of time needed to accurately document a service.

## Unit tests of controller logic
Unit tests involve testing a part of an app in isolation from its infrastructure and dependencies. When unit testing controller logic, only the contents of a single action are tested, not the behavior of its dependencies or of the framework itself.

Set up unit tests of controller actions to focus on the controller's behavior. A controller unit test avoids scenarios such as filters, routing, and model binding. Tests that cover the interactions among components that collectively respond to a request are handled by integration tests. For more information on integration tests, see Integration tests in ASP.NET Core.

If you're writing custom filters and routes, unit test them in isolation, not as part of tests on a particular controller action.
