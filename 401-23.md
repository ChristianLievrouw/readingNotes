# Read: Policies

## Policy-based authorization in ASP.NET Core
Underneath the covers, role-based authorization and claims-based authorization use a requirement, a requirement handler, and a pre-configured policy. These building blocks support the expression of authorization evaluations in code. The result is a richer, reusable, testable authorization structure.

## IAuthorizationService
The primary service that determines if authorization is successful is IAuthorizationService:

## Apply policies to MVC controllers
If you're using Razor Pages, see Apply policies to Razor Pages in this document.
Policies are applied to controllers by using the [Authorize] attribute with the policy name.

## Authorization handlers
An authorization handler is responsible for the evaluation of a requirement's properties. The authorization handler evaluates the requirements against a provided AuthorizationHandlerContext to determine if access is allowed.

A requirement can have multiple handlers. A handler may inherit AuthorizationHandler<TRequirement>, where TRequirement is the requirement to be handled. Alternatively, a handler may implement IAuthorizationHandler to handle more than one type of requirement.

## What should a handler return?
Note that the Handle method in the handler example returns no value. How is a status of either success or failure indicated?

A handler indicates success by calling context.Succeed(IAuthorizationRequirement requirement), passing the requirement that has been successfully validated.
A handler doesn't need to handle failures generally, as other handlers for the same requirement may succeed.

To guarantee failure, even if other requirement handlers succeed, call context.Fail.

If a handler calls context.Succeed or context.Fail, all other handlers are still called. This allows requirements to produce side effects, such as logging, which takes place even if another handler has successfully validated or failed a requirement. When set to false, the InvokeHandlersAfterFailure property short-circuits the execution of handlers when context.Fail is called. InvokeHandlersAfterFailure defaults to true, in which case all handlers are called.

## Customize policy retrieval
ASP.NET Core apps use an implementation of the IAuthorizationPolicyProvider interface to retrieve authorization policies. By default, DefaultAuthorizationPolicyProvider is registered and used. DefaultAuthorizationPolicyProvider returns policies from the AuthorizationOptions provided in an IServiceCollection.AddAuthorization call.

Customize this behavior by registering a different IAuthorizationPolicyProvider implementation in the app's dependency injection container.

The IAuthorizationPolicyProvider interface contains three APIs:

GetPolicyAsync returns an authorization policy for a given name.
GetDefaultPolicyAsync returns the default authorization policy (the policy used for [Authorize] attributes without a policy specified).
GetFallbackPolicyAsync returns the fallback authorization policy (the policy used by the Authorization Middleware when no policy is specified).
By implementing these APIs, you can customize how authorization policies are provided.
