# Reading: System.IO
- In the .NET Framework, the System.IO namespaces contain types that enable reading and writing, both synchronously and asynchronously, on data streams and files. These namespaces also contain types that perform compression and decompression on files, and types that enable communication through pipes and serial ports.

## Here are some commonly used file and directory classes:

- File - provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object.
- FileInfo - provides instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object.
- Directory - provides static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.
- DirectoryInfo - provides instance methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.
- Path - provides methods and properties for processing directory strings in a cross-platform manner.

## Streams
- The abstract base class Stream supports reading and writing bytes. All classes that represent streams inherit from the Stream class. The Stream class and its derived classes provide a common view of data sources and repositories, and isolate the programmer from the specific details of the operating system and underlying devices.

## Streams involve three fundamental operations:
- Reading - transferring data from a stream into a data structure, such as an array of bytes.
- Writing - transferring data to a stream from a data source.
- Seeking - querying and modifying the current position within a stream.

## Compression 
- Compression refers to the process of reducing the size of a file for storage. Decompression is the process of extracting the contents of a compressed file so they are in a usable format. 

## Isolated storage
- Isolated storage is a data storage mechanism that provides isolation and safety by defining standardized ways of associating code with saved data. The storage provides a virtual file system that is isolated by user, assembly, and (optionally) domain. Isolated storage is particularly useful when your application does not have permission to access user files. You can save settings or files for your application in a manner that is controlled by the computer's security policy.

## The following classes and methods are typically used to write text to a file:
- StreamWriter contains methods to write to a file synchronously (Write and WriteLine) or asynchronously (WriteAsync and WriteLineAsync).
- File provides static methods to write text to a file, such as WriteAllLines and WriteAllText, or to append text to a file, such as AppendAllLines, AppendAllText, and AppendText.
- Path is for strings that have file or directory path information. It contains the Combine method and, in .NET Core 2.1 and later, the Join and TryJoin methods, which allow concatenation of strings to build a file or directory path.
