# Reading: Unit testing and documentation
## Unit testing
- Unit tests isolate and exercise specific units of your code.
## README
 intent of README: "This is important information for the user to read before proceeding." Let's explore together what constitutes "important information" in this modern age.

 Other reasons for README
 - even if you do not plan to share code it helps when you look back on your own old code.
 - if others are trying to understand your code it can act like a  blue print

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to:

1. tell them what it is (with context)
2. show them what it looks like in action
3. show them how they use it
4. tell them any other relevant details

 The ideal README is as short as it can be without being any shorter. Detailed documentation is good -- make separate pages for it! -- but keep your README succinct.

## Good practices
1. Consider including a Background section if your module depends on important but not widely known abstractions or other ecosystems.
2. Aggressively linkify! If you talk about other modules, ideas, or people, make that reference text a link so that visitors can more easily grok your module and the ideas it builds on.
3. Include information on types of arguments and return parameters if it's not obvious.
4.  please remember that your version control repository and its embedded README will outlive your repository host and any of the things you hyperlink to -- especially images -- so inline anything that is essential to future users grokking your work.
