# Read: Class 31 - View Components
## View components
View components are similar to partial views, but they're much more powerful. View components don't use model binding, and only depend on the data provided when calling into it. This article was written using controllers and views, but view components also work with Razor Pages.

## A view component:
Renders a chunk rather than a whole response.
Includes the same separation-of-concerns and testability benefits found between a controller and view.
Can have parameters and business logic.
Is typically invoked from a layout page.
View components are intended anywhere you have reusable rendering logic that's too complex for a partial view, such as:

Dynamic navigation menus
Tag cloud (where it queries the database)
Login panel
Shopping cart
Recently published articles
Sidebar content on a typical blog
A login panel that would be rendered on every page and show either the links to log out or log in, depending on the log in state of the user

## The view component class
A view component class can be created by any of the following:

Deriving from ViewComponent
Decorating a class with the [ViewComponent] attribute, or deriving from a class with the [ViewComponent] attribute
Creating a class where the name ends with the suffix ViewComponent

## View component methods
A view component defines its logic in an InvokeAsync method that returns a Task<IViewComponentResult> or in a synchronous Invoke method that returns an IViewComponentResult. Parameters come directly from invocation of the view component, not from model binding. A view component never directly handles a request. Typically, a view component initializes a model and passes it to a view by calling the View method.

## View search path
The runtime searches for the view in the following paths:

/Views/{Controller Name}/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
/Views/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
/Pages/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
