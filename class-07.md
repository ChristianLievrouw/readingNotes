# Reading: Object oriented programming
## Basic Table structure
```<table>```
  ```<tr>```
    ```<th>```
    ```<td></td>```
    ```</th>```
  ```</tr>```
```</table>```

## spanning columns and rows
- colspan="3" - stretches across more than one columns
- rowspan="3" - stretches across more than one row
- on long tables you might want to label sections of the table ans with that you would use
- ```<thead>```
- ```<tbody>```
- ```<tfoot>```
 
## width, spacing, border, background (old code)
you may run into old code that is outdated such as width, spacing, border, and background color inline, now days we use css for those type of things

# functions, methods, and objects
``` var nul = new object(); ```
- will create a new object you can add properties and methods to
``` object.propertyName = propertyValue ```
- updating values of properties
## Three types of built in objects
1. browser Object Model
- creates model of browser tab or window
2. document object model 
- creates model of the current web page
3. global javascript objects
- group individual objects related to different parts of javascript language
