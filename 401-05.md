# Read: Linked list
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Terminology:
Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
Head - The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
Current - The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, you typically reset the current to the head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

## Traversal
When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.

When constructing your code, a few things to keep in mind.

When making your Node class, consider requiring a value to be passed in to require that each node has a value.

When making a Linked List, you may want to require that at least one node gets passed in upon instantiation. This first node is what your Head and Current will point too.

Singly linked lists are the simplest type of linked list, based solely on the fact that they only go in one direction. There is a single track that we can traverse the list in; we start at the head node, and traverse from the root until the last node, which will end at an empty null value.

But just as a node can reference its subsequent neighbor node, it can also have a reference pointer to its preceding node, too! This is what we call a doubly linked list, because there are two references contained within each node: a reference to the next node, as well as the previous node. This can be helpful if we wanted to be able to traverse our data structure not just in a single track or direction, but also backwards, too.

A circular linked list is a little odd in that it doesnâ€™t end with a node pointing to a null value. Instead, it has a node that acts as the tail of the list (rather than the conventional head node), and the node after the tail node is the beginning of the list. This organization structure makes it really easy to add something to the end of the list, because you can begin traversing it at the tail node, as the first element and last element point to one another. Circular linked lists can start to get really crazy because we can turn both a singly linked list and a doubly linked list into a circular linked list!
